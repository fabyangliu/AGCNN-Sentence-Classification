# AGCNN_sentence_classification
Demo code for the paper [An Attention-Gated Convolutional Neural Network for Sentence Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.07325) <br>
(accepted for publication in the IDA journal).<br>
Runs the AGCNN-rand model on the CR dataset (Customer Review dataset, by M. Hu and B. Liu).

## Requirements
* Python     (3.6)
* Tensorflow (1.12.0_gpu)
* Gensim     (3.7.3)
* Pre-trained `word2vec` google word vectors
